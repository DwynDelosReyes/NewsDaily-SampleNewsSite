# News Daily
### Sample News Site
***
### 📄 Project Overview

This project is a frontend-only demonstration of a modern news website layout, designed to showcase UI/UX decisions, layout structure, and contemporary frontend development practices. All articles, headlines, and descriptions throughout the site are entirely fictional and exist solely to visualize how a real news platform might look and function.

Every news card on the website redirects to a sample article page, which intentionally breaks the fourth wall by explaining the project itself. No real news content is provided, and no backend or data fetching is implemented.

### 🎨 Design & Layout Philosophy

The goal of this project is to explore how a modern news platform can balance:
- Readability
- Content variety
- Clear categorization
- Visual hierarchy

…without overwhelming the user.

Key layout decisions include:
1. A navbar for broad, primary categories
2. A sidebar for navigating numerous subcategories common to news platforms
3. A multi-column article layout to simulate real-world news density
4. A right-hand column showcasing additional articles and an advertisement placeholder
5 The design intentionally uses a limited three-color palette to maintain a clean and cohesive aesthetic, allowing different sections to stand out subtly without clutter.

### 🧱 Components & Structure

News cards arranged in structured three- and four-column grids
Rounded corners, consistent spacing, and clear typography hierarchy
“Loading…” cards and placeholder images used strictly for visualization
Certain sections (e.g., breaking updates) use text-only layouts to introduce variation while maintaining clarity
Fully responsive layout behavior when sidebars are retracted (desktop-focused)

⚠️ Note: The project is currently designed primarily for desktop screens and is not yet optimized for mobile devices.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- Shadcn UI for consistent component styling
- React Router DOM for client-side routing
There is no backend, no API integration, and no dynamic data fetching. This project exists purely as a frontend portfolio piece.

### 🖼️ Assets & Credits
All news card and advertisement images are sourced from free, no-copyright image websites
The homepage hero image and the sample article main image were custom-assembled specifically for this project

No ownership is claimed over third-party images

### 🎯 Purpose
This project is intended to demonstrate:
- Thoughtful UI/UX design
- Clean layout structuring
- Modern React + TypeScript usage
- Component-based architecture for content-heavy interfaces

While the content itself is fictional, the layout, navigation, and interactivity reflect realistic design choices that could be applied to a real-world news platform.
